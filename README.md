# order_translate
This project was developed with the purpose of ordering words from the i18n translations. Aiming to organize the locale.json files that are in the i18n folder of projects that have multilanguage. I hope you enjoy it because it is very simple to use and even to modify it.
 
 
To use:

Just import it and instantiate the interface that is contained in the i18n_core project and be happy with the methods.
